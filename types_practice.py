# Practice declaring variables and using different types

# create two variables: one containing your first name and another containing your last name
# use the print function to output your full name with a space between your first and last name
# transfer these variable values into a list
# take the variables and now store the values in a dictionary, using the keys 'first' and 'last'
# display the dictionary values
